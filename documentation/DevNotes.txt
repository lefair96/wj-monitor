If in Atom you do PlatformIO > run other target > PIO Upload it gets stuck with the "firmware" chances are that there are devices interferences on the same COM. for me, on COM5 i had both arduino and some bluetooth stuff. I disconnected bluetooth and restarted atom and then everything worked fine
to make an exe from python: pyinstaller file_name.py

I used a cronjob to run automatically the python opc ua server. It is to note that
it takes some time for the mango to boot up and connect to a network
so you need to add a delay to start opcUA serv (actually
it would be better to code a script that before opening opcua Server
it awaits for the mango to be up)

crontab -e
@reboot sleep 180 && python /usr/local/src/opcUA-Serv.py &
the final & makes the program run in background

ps -ef | grep python
pgrep -lf python
ps -aux | grep python
to check what python processes are running
